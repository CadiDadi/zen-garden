            <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
            <p>
              Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
              browser-specific tags, incompatible
              <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken
              <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and
              abandoned browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
              achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the
              <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>,
              <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major
              browser creators.

              The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the
              important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn
              to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating
              fashion. Become one with the web.

            <h3>So What Is This About?</h3>
            <p>
              There is a continuing need to show the power of
              <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden
              aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin,
              view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one
              will load the style sheet into this very page. The
              <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the
              same, the only thing that has changed is the external
              <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.
            </p>
            <p>
              <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete
              and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only
              way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is
              by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed
              in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure.
              Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the
              web; we can always push it further.

              Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying
              this page, so strong
              <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> skills are
              necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough
              that even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices
              can use them as starting points. Please see the

            </p>
            <p>
              You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the
              <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem
              daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but
              follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as
              a guide.

              to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your
              masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload
              your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web
              server under your control.

            should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong
            fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about
            functional, practical
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest
            bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only
            real requirement we have is that your
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have
            implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now.
            When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent
            results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user
            agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile
            — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform.
            That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should
            work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and
            Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
